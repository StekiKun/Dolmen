# Dolmen

## Gradle build

This project can be built using [gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).
You don't have anything to do to use gradle. Simply execute (from the `Dolmen` directory, i.e. here):

```shell
./gradlew build
```

This will generate Dolmen's jar in `Dolmen/build/libs` ðŸ¥³
