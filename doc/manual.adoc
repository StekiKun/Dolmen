Dolmen is a generator of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis[lexical analyzers] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing[parsers] for the Java
programming language. It will produce lexical analyzers
(resp. syntactic analyzers) based on textual lexer descriptions
(resp. grammar descriptions). Dolmen can be used declaratively, as a
library, to produce lexers and parsers from descriptions, or more
commonly as a command-line tool. There also exists a dedicated
https://github.com/StekiKun/DolmenPlugin[Eclipse plug-in] for Dolmen.
