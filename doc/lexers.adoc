In this chapter, we explain how to produce lexical analysers with
Dolmen by writing _Dolmen lexer descriptions_. We start by showing how
to write a simple lexer description for the JSON format before
presenting the various features of the lexer description format in
more detailed fashion. A complete reference for the lexer description
syntax can be found at <<Lexers_Syntax_Ref,the end of this chapter>>.
